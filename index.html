            <div class="second sec">
              <p>Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as the dominant figure of modern
                African
                literature. His first novel and magnum opus, Things Fall Apart (1958), occupies a pivotal placein African
                literature and
                remains the most widely studied, translated, and read African novel. He later went to on write other beautiful
                work of
                art, which are also well known and used by various educational institution for literature teaching. Born in
                Ogidi,
                British Nigeria, Achebe's childhood was influenced by both Igbo traditional culture and postcolonial
                Christianity. He
                excelled in school and attended what is now the University of Ibadan, where he became fiercely critical of how
                European
                literature depicted Africa.</p>

            <div class="second sec">
              <p>Akinwande Oluwole Soyinka, is a Nigerian playwright, novelist, poet, and essayist in the English language, and
                a
                political activist who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. Soyinka was born into a Yoruba family in
                Abeokuta. In 1954, he attended Government College in Ibadan, and subsequently University College Ibadan and the
                University of Leeds in England. Soyinka has been a strong critic of successive Nigerian (and African at large)
                governments, especially the country's many military dictators, as well as other political tyrannies, including
                the
                Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. Much of his writing has been concerned with "the oppressive boot and the irrelevance
                of the
                colour of the foot that wears it".</p>
